Blackbird,"Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Black bird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise,
You were only waiting for this moment to arise,
You were only waiting for this moment to arise"

Let It Be,"When I find 
myself
 in 
times
 of trouble, 
Mother
 Mary 
comes
 to me
Speaking 
words
 of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of 
darkness
 she is 
standing
 right in 
front
 of me
Speaking 
words
 of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper 
words
 of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken-hearted 
people
 living in the 
world
 agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For 
though
 they may be parted, 
there
 is 
still
 a 
chance
 that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, 
there
 will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper

And when the 
night
 is 
cloudy
 there is 
still
 a 
light
 that 
shines
 on me
Shine 
until
 tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the 
sound
 of music, 
Mother
 Mary 
comes
 to me

Old Brown Shoe,"I want a love that's right 
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl 
Who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now
I'm telling you

You know you pick me up 
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile 
Replace every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you

If I grow up I'll be a singer 
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say 
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather 
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late

For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you"
Martha My Dear,"Martha, my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation, please
Remember me
Martha, my love
Don't forget me
Martha, my dear

Hold your head up, you silly girl
Look what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

Take a good look around you
Take a good look you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be
With each other
Silly girl

Hold you're hand out, you silly girl
See what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

Martha, my dear
You have always been my inspiration
Please, be good to me
Martha, my love
Don't forget me
Martha, my dear."

One After 909,"My baby said she's trav'ling on the one

Octopus's Garden,"I'd like to be 
under
 the sea
In an octopus' 
garden
 in the shade
He'd let us in, 
knows
 where we've been
In his octopus' 
garden
 in the shade

I'd ask my 
friends
 to come and see
An octopus' 
garden
 with me
I'd like to be 
under
 the sea
In an octopus' 
garden
 in the shade.

We 
would
 be warm 
below
 the storm
In our 
little
 hideaway 
beneath
 the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus' 
garden
 near a cave

We 
would
 sing and 
dance
 around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be 
under
 the sea
In an octopus' 
garden
 in the shade

We 
would
 shout and swim about
The 
coral
 that lies 
beneath
 the waves
(Lies 
beneath
 the 
ocean
 waves)
Oh what joy for 
every
 girl and boy
Knowing they're 
happy
 and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We 
would
 be so 
happy
 you and me
No one 
there
 to tell us what to do
I'd like to be 
under
 the sea
In an octopus' 
garden
 with you."
She Came in Through the Bathroom Window,"She came in

All these years I've been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you. 

Ev'rybody had a hard year
Ev'rybody had a good time
Ev'rybody had a wet dream,
Ev'rybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ev'rybody had a good year,
Ev'rybody let their hair down,
Ev'rybody pulled their socks up,
Ev'rybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man

She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man"

Believe me when I beg you
Don't ever leave me alone

Rock and Roll Music,"Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man a'wail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were goin' like a hurricane

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up

And started playin' that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me)
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me now that you've seen)
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me)

Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music

While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps.

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you.

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps.

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you.

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps."

Would you 
promise
 to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I 
found
 that love was more
Than just 
holding
 hands

If I give my 
heart
 to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you 
would
 love me more than her

If I 
trust
 in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my 
pride
 like her

'Cause I couldn't 
stand
 the pain
And I 
would
 be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she 
learns
 we are two
If I fell in love with you"
Roll Over Beethoven,"I'm gonna write a little letter,
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rockin' rhythm record 
I want my jockey to play
Roll Over Beethoven, I gotta hear it again today

You know, my temperature's risin' 
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beatin' rhythm 
And my soul keeps on singin' the blues
Roll Over Beethoven and tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got the rockin' pneumonia, 
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I'm rollin' arthritis 
Sittin' down by the rhythm review
Roll Over Beethoven rockin' in two by two

Well, if you feel you like it
Go get your lover, then reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up just
A trifle further and reel and rock it,
Roll it over,
Roll Over Beethoven rockin' in two by two

Well, early in the mornin' I'm a-givin' you a warnin' 
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle, I am playin' my fiddle,
Ain't got nothin' to lose
Roll Over Beethoven and tell Tschaikowsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm,
Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner, 
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime the music will never stop

Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven and dig these rhythm and blues"

Introduction,"Wilson, Wilson
Wilson, Wilson
Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle"

Sweet Little Sixteen,"They're really rocking in Boston, 
In Philadelphia PA, 
Deep in the heart of Texas, 
On down the Frisco Bay. 
All over Saint Louis 
And down in New Orleans. 
All the cats want to dance with 
Sweet little sixteen. 

Sweet little sixteen, 
She's just got to have 
About half a million 
Framed autopraphs. 
Her wall is filled with pictures, 
She gets them one by one. 
Becomes so excited, 
Oh watch her at the run boy. 

Oh mommy mommy, 
Please may I go. 
You know it's such a sight to see 
Somebody steal the show. 
Oh daddy daddy, 
I beg of you. 
Please say it to mommy 
It's alright with you. 

Sweet little sixteen 
She's got the grown up blues. 
Tight dresses and lipstick, 
She's sporting in high heeled boots. 
Oh but tomorrow morning 
She'll have to change her trend 
Become sweet sixteen 
And back in class again. 

They're really rocking in Boston, 
In Philadelphia PA, 
Deep in the heart of Texas 
And down the Frisco Bay. 
All over Saint Louis, 
On down in New Orleans. 
All the cats want to dance with 
Sweet little sixteen"
Lend Me Your Comb,"Lend me your comb
It's time to go home 
I got to go past
My hair is a mess 

Your mammie will scold
Your pappie will shout
Unless we come in 
The way we went out

Kissing you was fun honey 
But thanks for the date
But I must come to run honey 
But you know baby it's getting late

Just wait till I say
My darling
Lend me your comb
We got to go home
Kissing you was fun honey

But thanks for the date 
But I must come to run, honey
But sugar, it's getting late

Just wait till I 
Say, my darling
Lend me your comb
We got to go home"
Mr. Moonlight,"Mister Moonlight
You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream
And from the world you sent my girl
And from above you sent us love
And now she is mine, I think you're fine

Mister Moonlight come again please
Here I am on my knees begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
I pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you Mister Moonlight

And the night you don't come my way
I pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you Mister Moonlight

Here I am on my knees begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
I pray and pray more each day

"Here, There and Everywhere","To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere"

And I Love Her,"I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her to
I love her

She 
gives
 my everything
And tenderly
The kiss my 
lover
 brings
She 
brings
 to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could 
never
 die
As long as I
Have you near me

Bright are the 
stars
 that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will 
never
 die
And I love her

Bright are the 
stars
 that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will

I Call Your Name,"I call your name but you're not there
Was I to blame for being unfair
Oh, I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night
I can't go on

Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man

Oh, I can't sleep at night

No Reply,"This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasn't you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
'Cause I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
That's a lie,
'Cause I know where you've been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

I've tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
That's a lie,
'Cause I know where you've been,
I saw you walk in your door,

With another man in my place.

Let It Be,"When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be.
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be. Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be.

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be."
"Hallelujah, I Love Her So","Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know

She brings me coffee in my favorite cup

When I'm in trouble and I have no friend
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say, ""She told me so""
That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now, if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her - on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
And tells me, ""Daddy, everything's all right""
That's why I know, yes, I know

Now I find I've 
changed
 my mind, I've 
opened
 up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm 
feeling
 down
And I do 
appreciate
 you 
being
 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, 
please
 help me?

(Now) and now my life has 
changed
 (my life has changed) in oh-so-many ways (my independence)
My 
independence
 seems to 
vanish
 in the haze
(But) but 
every
 now and then (now and then) I feel so 
insecure
 (I know that I)
I know that I just need you like I 
never
 done before

Help me if you can, I'm 
feeling
 down
And I do 
appreciate
 you 
being
 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, 
please
 help me?

When I was younger, so much 
younger
 than today
I 
never
 needed anybody's help in any way
(Now) but now 
these
 days are gone (these days are gone) I'm not so self-assured (and now I find)
Now I find, I've 
changed
 my mind, I've 
opened
 up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm 
feeling
 down
And I do 
appreciate
 you 
being
 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, 
please
 help me, help me, help me, ooh?"
