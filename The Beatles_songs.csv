Blackbird,"Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Black bird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise,
You were only waiting for this moment to arise,
You were only waiting for this moment to arise"

Let It Be,"When I find 
myself
 in 
times
 of trouble, 
Mother
 Mary 
comes
 to me
Speaking 
words
 of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of 
darkness
 she is 
standing
 right in 
front
 of me
Speaking 
words
 of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper 
words
 of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken-hearted 
people
 living in the 
world
 agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For 
though
 they may be parted, 
there
 is 
still
 a 
chance
 that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be

 is 
cloudy
 there is 
still
 a 
light
 that 
shines
 on me
Shine 
until
 tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the 
sound
 of music,

Maggie Mae,"Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin' Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay"
Old Brown Shoe,"I want a love that's 
right
 
But 
right
 is only half of what's wrong
I want a 
short
 haired girl 
Who 
sometimes
 wears it 
twice
 as long
Now I'm 
stepping
 out this old 
brown
 shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now
I'm 
telling
 you

You know you pick me up 
From 
where
 some try to drag me down
And when I see your 
smile
 
Replace 
every
 thoughtless frown
Got me 
escaping
 from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you

If I grow up I'll be a 
singer
 
Wearing 
rings
 on 
every
 finger
Not 
worrying
 what they or you say 
I'll live and love and 
maybe
 someday
Who knows, baby, you may 
comfort
 me

I may 
appear
 to be imperfect
My love is 
something
 you can't reject
I'm 
changing
 faster than the 
weather
 
If you and me 
should
 get together
Who knows, baby, you may 
comfort
 me

I want that love of yours
To miss that love is 
something
 I'd hate
I'll make an 
early
 start
I'm 
making
 sure that I'm not late

For you 
sweet
 top lip I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now 
When I'm with you"

Hold your head up, you 
silly
 girl
Look what you've done
When you find 
yourself
 in the 
thick
 of it
Help 
yourself
 to a bit of what is all 
around
 you
Silly girl

Take a good look 
around
 you
Take a good look you're 
bound
 to see
That you and me were 
meant
 to be
With each other
Silly girl

Hold you're hand out, you 
silly
 girl
See what you've done
When you find 
yourself
 in the 
thick
 of it
Help 
yourself
 to a bit of what is all 
around

Martha, my dear
You have 
always
 been my inspiration
Please, be good to me

One After 909,"My baby said she's trav'ling on the one 
after

I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.

 her not to go and I 
begged
 her on my

You're only 
fooling
 around, you're 
fooling
 around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.

I Want You,Lyrics not found for 'I Want You' by 'The Beatles'.
Octopus's Garden,"I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus' garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus' garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus' garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden with you."
She Came in Through the Bathroom Window,"She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday,
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh yeah"
I've Got a Feeling,"I've got a feeling, a 
feeling

Yeah I've got a feeling. 

Oh

Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you 
leave
 me I won't be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah I've got a 
feeling
 yeah. 

All 
these
 years I've been 
wandering
 around,
Wondering how come 
nobody
 told me
All that I was 
looking
 for was somebody
Who 
looked
 like you. 

Ev'rybody had a hard year
Ev'rybody had a good time
Ev'rybody had a wet dream,
Ev'rybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ev'rybody had a good year,
Ev'rybody let 
their
 hair down,
Ev'rybody 
pulled
 their 
socks
 up,
Ev'rybody put 
their
 foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

Rock and Roll Music,"Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man a'wail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were goin' like a hurricane

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up

And started playin' that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me)
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me now that you've seen)
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me)
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to gear a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me"

Two of Us,"Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
Two of us Sunday driving
Not arriving

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere

On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home"

While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps.

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you.

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps.

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you.

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps."

If I Fell,"If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you"
Roll Over Beethoven,"I'm gonna write a little letter,
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rockin' rhythm record 
I want my jockey to play
Roll Over Beethoven, I gotta hear it again today

You know, my temperature's risin' 
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beatin' rhythm 
And my soul keeps on singin' the blues
Roll Over Beethoven and tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got the rockin' pneumonia, 
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I'm rollin' arthritis 
Sittin' down by the rhythm review
Roll Over Beethoven rockin' in two by two

Well, if you feel you like it
Go get your lover, then reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up just
A trifle further and reel and rock it,
Roll it over,
Roll Over Beethoven rockin' in two by two

Well, early in the mornin' I'm a-givin' you a warnin' 
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle, I am playin' my fiddle,
Ain't got nothin' to lose
Roll Over Beethoven and tell Tschaikowsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm,
Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner, 
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime the music will never stop

Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven and dig these rhythm and blues"

Introduction,"Wilson, Wilson

Wilson

Once upon a time 
there
 was a mountain
That rose out of a vast 
green
 forest
And in the 
forest
 there were birds
And 
lakes
 and 
rocks
 and 
trees
 and rivers

The 
forest
 was also inhabited
By a 
small
 group of 
people
 called the lizards
The 
lizards
 were a 
simple
 people
And they had 
lived
 in the 
forest
 undisturbed
For 
thousands
 of 
years
 in 
utter
 peace and tranquility

Once a year when 
spring
 came
And the 
first
 blossoms 
began
 to show
The 
lizards
 would 
gather
 at the base of the mountain
To give 
thanks
 for all that they had

They 
thanked
 the birds
And they 
thanked
 the 
lakes
 and they 
thanked
 the rocks
And the 
trees
 and the rivers
But most importantly, they 
thanked
 Icculus

Icculus 
lived
 at the top of the mountain
Or at 
least
 everyone 
thought
 so
For no one had 
actually
 ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the 
Helping
 Friendly Book
Icculus had 
given
 the 
Helping
 Friendly Book
To the 
Lizards
 thousands of 
years
 earlier as a gift

It 
contained
 all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had 
enabled
 the Lizards
To 
exist
 in 
harmony
 with 
nature
 for years

And so they lived
Until one day a 
traveler
 arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he 
quickly
 became intrigued
By the 
Lizards
 way of life

He 
asked
 if he 
could
 stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had 
never
 seen an outsider
Were 
happy
 to oblige

Wilson 
lived
 with the 
Lizards
 for a few years
Studying the ways of the 
Helping
 Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one 
morning
 when they 
awoke
 and the book was gone
Wilson 
explained
 that he had 
hidden
 the book
Knowing that the 
Lizards
 had become
Dependent on it for survival

He 
declared
 himself king
And 
enslaved
 the 
innocent
 people of Gamehendge
He cut down the 
trees
 and 
built
 a city
Which he 
called
 Prussia

And in the 
center
 of the city
He 
built
 a castle
And 
locked
 in the 
highest
 tower of the castle"

Sweet Little Sixteen,"They're really rocking in Boston,

On down the Frisco Bay. 
All over Saint Louis 
And down in New Orleans. 
All the cats want to dance with 
Sweet little sixteen. 

Sweet little sixteen, 
She's just got to have 
About half a million 
Framed autopraphs. 
Her wall is filled with pictures, 
She gets them one by one. 
Becomes so excited, 
Oh watch her at the run boy. 

Oh mommy mommy, 
Please may I go. 
You know it's such a sight to see 
Somebody steal the show. 
Oh daddy daddy, 
I beg of you. 
Please say it to mommy 
It's alright with you. 

Sweet little sixteen 
She's got the grown up blues. 
Tight dresses and lipstick, 
She's sporting in high heeled boots. 
Oh but tomorrow morning 
She'll have to change her trend 
Become sweet sixteen 
And back in class again. 

They're really rocking in Boston, 
In Philadelphia PA, 
Deep in the heart of Texas 
And down the Frisco Bay.

running

 how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's 
beside
 me I know I need

But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

You Can't Do That,"I got something to say that might cause you pain,
If I catch you talking to that boy again,

I'm gonna let you down,
And leave you flat,
Because I told you before, oh,
You can't do that.

Well, it's the second time, I've caught you talking to him,
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it's a sin,
I think I'll let you down.
Let you down and leave you flat,
Gonna let you down and leave you flat,
Because I've told you before, oh,
You can't do that.

Ev'rybody's green,
'cause I'm the one, who won your love,
But if it's seen,
You're talking that way they'd laugh in my face.
So please listen to me, if you want to stay mine,
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind.

I know I'll let you down,
And leave you flat,
Gonna let you down and leave you flat,
Because I've told you before, oh,
You can't do that."
Roll Over Beethoven,"I'm gonna write a little letter,
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rockin' rhythm record 
I want my jockey to play
Roll Over Beethoven, I gotta hear it again today

You know, my temperature's risin' 
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beatin' rhythm 
And my soul keeps on singin' the blues
Roll Over Beethoven and tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got the rockin' pneumonia, 
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I'm rollin' arthritis 
Sittin' down by the rhythm review
Roll Over Beethoven rockin' in two by two

Well, if you feel you like it
Go get your lover, then reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up just
A trifle further and reel and rock it,
Roll it over,
Roll Over Beethoven rockin' in two by two

Well, early in the mornin' I'm a-givin' you a warnin' 
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle, I am playin' my fiddle,
Ain't got nothin' to lose
Roll Over Beethoven and tell Tschaikowsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm,
Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner, 
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime the music will never stop

Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven and dig these rhythm and blues"

Roll Over Beethoven,"I'm gonna write a little letter,
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rockin' rhythm record 
I want my jockey to play
Roll Over Beethoven, I gotta hear it again today

You know, my temperature's risin' 
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beatin' rhythm 
And my soul keeps on singin' the blues
Roll Over Beethoven and tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got the rockin' pneumonia, 
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I'm rollin' arthritis 
Sittin' down by the rhythm review
Roll Over Beethoven rockin' in two by two

Well, if you feel you like it
Go get your lover, then reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up just
A trifle further and reel and rock it,
Roll it over,
Roll Over Beethoven rockin' in two by two

Well, early in the mornin' I'm a-givin' you a warnin' 
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle, I am playin' my fiddle,
Ain't got nothin' to lose
Roll Over Beethoven and tell Tschaikowsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm,
Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner, 
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime the music will never stop

Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven and dig these rhythm and blues"

Roll Over Beethoven,"I'm gonna write a little letter,
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rockin' rhythm record 
I want my jockey to play
Roll Over Beethoven, I gotta hear it again today

You know, my temperature's risin' 
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beatin' rhythm 
And my soul keeps on singin' the blues
Roll Over Beethoven and tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got the rockin' pneumonia, 
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I'm rollin' arthritis 
Sittin' down by the rhythm review
Roll Over Beethoven rockin' in two by two

Well, if you feel you like it
Go get your lover, then reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up just
A trifle further and reel and rock it,
Roll it over,
Roll Over Beethoven rockin' in two by two

Well, early in the mornin' I'm a-givin' you a warnin' 
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle, I am playin' my fiddle,
Ain't got nothin' to lose
Roll Over Beethoven and tell Tschaikowsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm,
Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner, 
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime the music will never stop

Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven,
Roll Over Beethoven and dig these rhythm and blues"

Rock and Roll Music,"Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man a'wail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were goin' like a hurricane

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up

And started playin' that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me)
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me now that you've seen)
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me)
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to gear a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me"

We Can Work It Out,"Try to see it my way,

Run the risk of

 that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out,
We can work it out

Think of what you're saying
You can get it 
wrong

still
 you 
think
 that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying,
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night
We can work it out,
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For 
fussing
 and fighting, my friend
I have 
always
 thought that it's a crime,
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am 
right
 or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a 
chance
 that we may fall 
apart
 before too long
We can work it out,
We can work it out

Yellow Submarine,"In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

(Full speed ahead Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead
Full speed ahead it is, Sergeant.
Cut the cable, drop the cable
Aye, Sir, aye
Captain, captain)

As we live a life of ease
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine"
Eleanor Rigby,"Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?"
Penny Lane,"Penny Lane 
there
 is a 
barber
 showing photographs
Of 
every
 head he's had the 
pleasure
 to know.
And all the 
people
 that come and go
Stop and say ""Hello"".

On the 
corner
 is a 
banker
 with a motorcar,
And 
little
 children 
laugh
 at him 
behind
 his back.
And the 
banker
 never 
wears
 a mac
In the 
pouring
 rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There 
beneath
 the blue 
suburban
 skies
I sit, and 
meanwhile
 back
In 
Penny
 Lane 
there
 is a 
fireman
 with an hourglass,
And in his 
pocket
 is a 
portrait
 of the Queen.
He 
likes
 to keep his fire 
engine
 clean,
It's a 
clean
 machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and 
finger
 pies
In summer. 
Meanwhile
 back
Behind the 
shelter
 in the 
middle
 of the roundabout
The 
pretty
 nurse is 
selling
 poppies from a tray.
And 
though
 she 
feels
 as if she's in a play,
She is anyway.

In 
Penny
 Lane the 
barber
 shaves 
another
 customer,
We see the 
banker
 sitting 
waiting
 for a trim,
And then the 
fireman
 rushes in
From the 
pouring
 rain - very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There 
beneath
 the blue 
suburban
 skies
I sit, and 
meanwhile
 back.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There 
beneath

Lady Madonna,"Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet"

For some California grass

The Ballad of John and Yoko,"Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said you've got to go back,
You know they didn't even give us a chance.

Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honeymooning down by the Seine.

Peter Brown called to say,
You can make it OK,
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain.

Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, say what're you doing in bed,
I said we're only trying to get us some peace.

Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.

Last night the wife said,
Oh boy, when you're dead you 
Don't take nothing with you but your soul think!
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
Eating chocolate cake in a bag.

The newspapers said,
She's gone to his head,
They look just like two Gurus in a drag.
Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.

The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.
Caught the early plane back to London,
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said we wish you success,
It's good to have the both of you back.

Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me"
Something,"Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how"

Help!,"(Help) I need somebody
(Help) not just anybody
(Help) you know I need someone
(Help)

(When) when I was 
younger
 (when I was young) so much 
younger
 than today
(I 
never
 needed) I 
never
 needed anybody's help in any way
(Now) but now 
these
 days are gone (these days are gone) I'm not so self-assured (and now I find)
Now I find I've 
changed
 my mind, I've 
opened
 up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm 
feeling
 down
And I do 
appreciate
 you 
being
 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, 
please
 help me?

(Now) and now my life has 
changed
 (my life has changed) in oh-so-many ways (my independence)
My 
independence
 seems to 
vanish
 in the haze
(But) but 
every
 now and then (now and then) I feel so 
insecure
 (I know that I)
I know that I just need you like I 
never
 done before

Help me if you can, I'm 
feeling
 down
And I do 
appreciate
 you 
being
 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground

Yesterday,"Yesterday, all my 
troubles
 seemed so far away
Now it 
looks
 as 
though
 they're here to stay
Oh, I 
believe
 in yesterday.

Suddenly, I'm not half to man I used to be,
There's a 
shadow
 hanging over me.
Oh, 
yesterday
 came suddenly.

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say.
I said 
something
 wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a 
place
 to hide away.
Oh, I 
believe
 in yesterday."
